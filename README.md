# Subspace Chatbot App — Full Codebase

This repository contains a full-stack chatbot application using:
- Frontend: React + Vite + Apollo
- Authentication: Nhost (email/password)
- Backend: Hasura GraphQL + Postgres
- Workflow/orchestration: n8n + OpenRouter (free model)
- Deployment: Netlify (frontend)

Follow docs/* for architecture, deployment, permissions. Replace placeholders in .env.example files and update action handler URLs.

Good luck — if you want, I can:
- Generate a zip with all files ready to git clone.
- Push this structure to a GitHub repo for you.
- Deploy the frontend to Netlify and link it with envs.

Tell me which action next and I’ll do it.
